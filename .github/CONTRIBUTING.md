# Contributing

Firstly, I'm really happy that you want to contribute. :smile:

But before contributing, be sure to respect all the following steps. 

### Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. Any branch must be merged into `master` except `dev` one.
2. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.

### Creating a Pull Request

1. `git checkout dev` (checkout to `dev` branch).
2. `git checkout -b branch_name` (where `branch_name` is the name of your branch).
3. Commit your modifications.
4. [Create a Pull Request](https://github.com/baudev/Firebase-Cloud-Messaging-FCM-XMPP/compare/dev...) where the **base** branch is `dev` and the **compare** branch is your branch (`branch_name`).

It's done :tada:

### Releases

Making new releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.
